# priobike

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Running without attached XCode

Flutter has a known limitation: [you can only run the app in debug mode while XCode is attached](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ios-14#launching-debug-flutter-without-a-host-computer). Therefore, to run the app in detached mode, use:

```
flutter run --release
```
