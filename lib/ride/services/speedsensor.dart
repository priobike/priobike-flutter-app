  To get the correct data from the sensor, we subscribed to all available
  services. Some of them had multiple characteristics.
  Some of the characteristics only had constant data. Others were also subscribable
  with updating data.
  We subscribed to every one of them & looked at the data they delivered, when
  we imitated the physical movement of a wheel with the sensor.

  Below you can find the service uuid along with it's characteristic uuid
  responsible for delivering new rotation data.

  By looking at the data, i guessed it's structured like this:
  [a, b, c, d, e, f, g]
  a= [constantly 1]
  b= current number of rotations
  c= increased by one, if b would have been higher than 255
  -> c++, if new_b % 255 < previous_b % 255
  f= current angle
  g= difference between current f and previously sent f
  d= [constantly 0]
  e= [constantly 0]
